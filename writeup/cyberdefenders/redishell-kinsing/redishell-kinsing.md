# RediShell - Kinsing

## Scenario
Before the ransomware deployment, the attackers established initial access through a misconfigured CI/CD server running in a Docker container within Wowza's development network. Security monitoring detected unusual outbound connections from the container subnet to a suspicious external IP address. A packet capture was initiated automatically but was terminated when the attacker discovered and killed the monitoring process. Your task is to analyze this network traffic to understand how the attackers gained their initial foothold and moved laterally within the containerized environment.
